= Update Guide to version 2.x for OpenDevStack users
:experimental:
:page-layout: documentation
:toc:

Learn all about how to update your OpenDevStack based project to ODS 2.x.

NOTE: It is assumed that you are updating from ODS 1.2.x.

== Required steps

=== Update version references

First, go into your `*-cd` namespace and edit the deployments (`jenkins` and
`webhook-proxy`) to point to the new tags (via "Actions" > "Edit").

Then, edit every `Jenkinsfile`. The shared library should point to `2.x`, e.g.:

[source,groovy]
----
library identifier: 'ods-library@2.x', retriever: modernSCM(
  [$class: 'GitSCMSource',
   remote: sharedLibraryRepository,
   credentialsId: credentialsId])
----

Also, the image used to run the pipeline in should point to `2.x`, e.g.:
[source,groovy]
----
odsPipeline(
  image: "${dockerRegistry}/cd/jenkins-slave-maven:2.x",
  ...
)
----

=== Grant image-puller rights to your `*-cd` namespace

This step is not strictly necessary, but recommended as projects created with
version `2.x` will have those rights by default. Having this setup will enable
you to use the `*-cd` namespace for common base images to reduce build times.

Run the following, replacing `$PROJECT_ID` with your project ID:

[source,sh]
----
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:$PROJECT_ID-test -n $PROJECT_ID-cd
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:$PROJECT_ID-dev -n $PROJECT_ID-cd
----

For more information, see https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/issues/293[ods-core#293].

=== Component resource constraints

Newly created components now have memory quotas
(https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/issues/12[ods-quickstarters#12])
and CPU quotas (https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/issues/74[ods-quickstarters#74])
configured.

It is recommended (though not required) to configure resource constraints for
existing components as well. If you are unsure which values to set, refer to the
new defaults and check the current usage in the "Metrics" section in OpenShift.

== Notable changes

=== Component deployment behaviour

In the shared library, rollouts will be triggered manually now when no config/image trigger exists on the DeploymentConfig.

=== Jenkins slave NodeJS 8

The `cd/jenkins-slave-nodejs8-angular` image has been discontinued. Please update to
`cd/jenkins-slave-nodejs10-angular`. For more information, see https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/issues/71[ods-quickstarters#71].

=== New Tailor version

Tailor has been updated to 0.11.0 in the Jenkins slaves, see https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/issues/290[ods-core#290].

=== Deprecation of `shared-services` namespace

The `shared-images` namespace (containing common base images) has been
removed from new ODS 2.0 installation. For existing installations, it is likely
being kept for some time by the cluster administrator to enable users to react
to this change.

If you use a component based on the `ds-jupyter-notebook` or `ds-rshiny`
quickstarters, you should switch to using the new authentication approach, which
is uing an OpenShift OAuth proxy instead of a Nginx service. See
https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/issues/46[ods-quickstarters#46].

If you use the Airflow Quickstarter, its base images should now be built in your
`*-cd` namespace See
https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/issues/60[ods-quickstarters#60].

== New features

=== SonarQube quality gates

It is now possible to opt-in to failing the build if the SonarQube scan fails
the quality gate defined in SonarQube. To enable this, change the call of
`stageScanForSonarqube(context)` to `stageScanForSonarqube(context, true)`.
For more information, see https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library/issues/22[ods-jenkins-shared-library#22].

=== Skopeo
When working with images, you may make use of Skopeo, which is now part of the Jenkins slaves. See https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/issues/253[ods-core#253].

== Common / Known Issues

None at this point.
