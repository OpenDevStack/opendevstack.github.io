We have worked pretty hard to ease the local installation of the OpenDevStack and first of all we are done.
In this step we decided to change to an own OKD VM instead of Minishift, because we had a lot of feedback about problems with getting Minishift work in corporate networks.
To reflect all the latest changes, we have also written a new [installation guide](https://www.opendevstack.org/ods-documentation/opendevstack/latest/administration/installation.html) for local installations.

Check it out, we appreciate your feedback.
